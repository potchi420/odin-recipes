        <ul>
            <li>1 lb beef sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup calamansi juice (or lemon juice)</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 large onion, sliced into rings</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine soy sauce, calamansi juice, minced garlic, and ground black pepper. Add the sliced beef and marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the beef from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and cook the beef in batches until browned. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add the sliced onions and cook until they are soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Return the beef to the skillet and pour in the reserved marinade along with 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve hot with steamed rice.</li>
        </ol>
